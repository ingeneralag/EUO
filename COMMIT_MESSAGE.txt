ðŸ”§ Fix Static Assets Issue for PM2+Nginx Deployment

Problem Fixed:
Website was showing HTML only without CSS/JS when deployed with PM2+Nginx.
Static assets (/_next/static/*) were returning 404 errors.

Root Cause:
- output: 'standalone' in next.config.ts is ONLY for Docker deployments
- This mode creates custom server with different file paths
- When using 'next start' with PM2, it couldn't find static files
- Standalone mode expects Docker to copy files to specific locations

Changes Made:

1. next.config.ts
   - Removed: output: 'standalone' (Docker-only feature)
   - Added: generateEtags for better caching
   - Improved: Comments explaining why changes were made

2. ecosystem.config.js (PM2 Configuration)
   - Improved: Better comments and documentation
   - Changed: Use node directly instead of npm (faster)
   - Added: Proper logging and graceful shutdown

3. nginx.conf.example
   - Complete rewrite with comprehensive configuration
   - Added: Specific location blocks for /_next/static/
   - Added: Aggressive caching for static assets
   - Added: Security headers and gzip compression

4. Documentation Files (NEW)
   - PROBLEM-ANALYSIS.md: Deep dive into root cause
   - DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md: Step-by-step deployment guide
   - VPS-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md: Complete VPS setup guide
   - deploy-vps.sh: Automated deployment script

Expected Results:
- Static assets load correctly (200 OK)
- CSS applies correctly
- JavaScript executes
- Website fully functional

Deployment Steps:
1. git pull origin main
2. npm ci --production=false
3. npm run build
4. pm2 restart sitovia-website
5. Update nginx configuration
